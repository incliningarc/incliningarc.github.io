      <p>Inspired by <a href="http://easternblot.net/2013/09/06/please-do-not-publish-my-thesis/">Eva Amsen’s response to Scholars’ Press</a>, I responded as follows. Additional background on the VDM conglomerate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDM_Publishing">here</a> and <a href="http://scholarlyoa.com/2012/11/05/lambert-academic-publishing-a-must-to-avoid/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Dear Anaya,</p>

<p>As you point out, your company found my thesis in the University of Illinois’s free repository. The U of I provides persistent and reliable access to research by faculty, staff, and students. I don’t want my doctoral research printed on paper and sold for profit – that’s why I chose to share it for free electronically.</p>

<p>Also, my scholarship is in the humanities, not science.</p>

<p>I should add that Scholar’s Press (and VDM) isn’t doing itself any marketing favors by emailing a generation of young scholars who are passionate about Open Access, Open Culture, and Open Science. The practices of Scholars’ Press, LAP LAMBERT and Omniscriptum, including reselling freely available Wikipedia articles, are in direct conflict with the goals of open scholarship (and really the entire spirit of the Internet).</p>

<p>No, I am not interested in publishing my freely available dissertation, but I do hope you’ll enjoy reading my discussion of how experimentations with novelistic genres allowed fin de siècle writers to develop new narrative forms capable of representing an increasingly global, interdependent, and actively anti-imperialist world.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Brandon</p>
