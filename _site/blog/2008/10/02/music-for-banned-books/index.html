      <p><em>This post was resurrected from a defunct music blog I worked on from 2008-2010. The blog wasn’t successful, but I always enjoyed this post.</em></p>

<p>It’s <a href="http://everybodyslibraries.com/2008/09/29/why-banned-books-week-matters/">Banned Books Week</a>, an annual celebration of artistic expression (the freedom to write) and the freedom of the press (the freedom to read), observed this year by <a href="http://www.amnestyusa.org/events/banned-books-week/page.do?id=1101492&n1=5&n2=50&n3=1611">Amnesty International</a>, the <a href="http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/oif/bannedbooksweek/bannedbooksweek.cfm">American Library Association</a>, and others. This isn’t just a ploy to get teenagers reading old books (as satirized by <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28619">the Onion</a> – it’s a chance to challenge yourself and challenge those around you by reading stuff others would rather you didn’t. Hey, finding those <a href="http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/banned-books.html#nowrite">books deemed unfit for minors</a> is pretty much what got me through high school. So, rather than pick up the relatively safe (but still naughty) Canterbury Tales or Fanny Hill, here’s my list of 5 riskier and more entertaining choices, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita">Lolita</a> (1955) by Nabokov (long unpublished in English, seized by customs in the UK, banned in France).</li>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atrocity_Exhibition">The Atrocity Exhibition</a> (1970) or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_%281973_novel%29">Crash</a> (1973) by Ballard. No, not the basis for the horrible movie with Ludacris, but it was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115964/">adapted by Cronenberg</a> and the 1996 film was also controversial. The first run of Ballard’s experimental Atrocity Exhibition was destroyed by Doubleday.</li>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_Lunch">Naked Lunch</a> (1959) by Burroughs. The target of the last major [print] censorship trial in the US. I bet you’d still have a hard time finding it in a school library.</li>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange">A Clockwork Orange</a> (1962) by Burgess. If you’ve seen Kubrick’s film, you can see why it’s frequently challenged and removed from school libraries.</li>
</ul>

<p>And while you’re taking a well-deserved break from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_%28novel%29">Ulysses</a>, why not listen to some banned music? We celebrate Banned Books Week, but the fight against censorship in music is still ongoing. Take a look back on</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbaFM_CA4mw">2 Live Crew - As Nasty As They Wanna Be</a>. 808 beats and a 1992 court overruling that remain at the heart of hip-hop.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkPb4s0-QcI">N.W.A. - Straight Outta Compton</a>. The classic album, as well as 2 Live’s Nasty, were both banned in Tennessee.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvOd48zlNkA">Public Enemy - Hazy Shade of Criminal</a>. Banned from MTV because of violence and yet it’s largely a protest against government-sanctioned violence, hmmmm….</li>

<li><a href="http://www.bannedmusic.org/albums/grey_album.php">DJ Dangermouse - The Grey Album</a>. <a href="http://www.bannedmusic.org/">Censorship continues under copyright law</a>, so here’s one of the highest achievements of “illegal” art ever.</li>
</ul>
