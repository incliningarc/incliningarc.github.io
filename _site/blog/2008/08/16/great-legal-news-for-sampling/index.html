      <p>Great news for those of you who love to sample (and those of you who love sample-style hip-hop from DJ Shadow to the Alchemist, from Ghostface to Kanye: the sample-stifling precedent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeport_Music_Inc._v._Dimension_Films">Bridgeport Music v. Dimension Films</a> has been <a href="http://lessig.org/mt/mt-tb.cgi/2256">rejected by the New York Supreme Court</a>.</p>

<p>In 2005, after a federal judge found that a two-second Funkadelic guitar chord used (without permission or compensation) in NWA’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6YOq2xn3k4">“100 Miles and Runnin”</a> did not violate copyright law, an appeals court reversed the decision. Barely concealing its contempt for hip-hop, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techpolicy/2004-09-08-sampling-ruling_x.htm">the court ordered</a>: “Get a license or do not sample. We do not see this as stifling creativity in any significant way.”</p>

<p>Recently, the litigious <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN2320158220080423">Yoko Ono attempted to block <em>Expelled: No Intelligence</em></a> because it contained 15 seconds of Lennon’s “Imagine.” In defense of the straightforward usage of Lennon’s song in the “intelligent design” film, the court’s decision rejected the Bridgeport/NWA precedent, which held that any sampling of music–no matter how minimal–violated copyright law.</p>

<p>By the way, the Bridgeport back-story gets more insidious. Apparently, Bridgeport (the music corporation) is simply one man, a notorious “sample troll” who brings suit after suit – <a href="http://hiphoparchive.org/thecircle/2006/12/01/jay-z-versus-the-sample-troll/">against Jay-Z recently</a> – in order to extort money from old rights. What’s more? <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/blog.php?company=bridgeport">George Clinton has explained that his signature was forged by Bridgeport on many of the contracts</a> for Funkdelic’s songs, including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siLtUWq0xio">“Get Off your Ass and Jam”</a> (the track in the NWA case).</p>
